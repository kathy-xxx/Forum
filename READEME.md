## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- MySQL installed and running
- Vite for running the frontend development server

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kathy-xxx/Forum.git
cd Forum
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. When the server starts, it will prompt you to enter the following database credentials in the terminal:
   - **Database Username**: The username for connecting to your MySQL database.
   - **Database Password**: The password associated with the database username.
   - **Database Name**: The name of the database you wish to connect to.

5. If the connection fails (e.g., incorrect credentials), the server will prompt you to enter the details again until a successful connection is established.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the application for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Serve the built application:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### Step 4: Database Configuration
- On starting the server, you will be prompted to provide MySQL database credentials (username, password, and database name).
- If the connection fails, re-enter the details until the connection succeeds.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the application.
2. Create an account or log in to access forum functionalities.
3. Join communities, create threads, and interact with other users.
